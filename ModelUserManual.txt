From 'OneDrive/Desktop/HelloWorld/MachineLearningTutorials/Notes.ipynb', you can find a tutorial on how to use pandas to handle categorical data and prepare it for training a decision tree.

{
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Example data
data = {
    'Age': [25, 30, 22, 28, 35, 27, 31, 29, 24],
    'Gender': ['Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male'],
    'Music': ['Rock', 'Pop', 'Jazz', 'Classical', 'Pop', 'Rock', 'Jazz', 'Classical', 'Pop'],
    'Target': [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]  # Example target variable
}

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Separate features and target
X = df[['Age', 'Gender', 'Music']].copy()  # Use .copy() to avoid SettingWithCopyWarning
y = df['Target']

# Encode categorical variables
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()

X.loc[:, 'Gender'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(X['Gender'])
X.loc[:, 'Music'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(X['Music'])

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the model
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Print the model's predictions for the test set
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print(predictions)
}

1. Import Libraries:
    {
    python

    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
    from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
    }
    pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    train_test_split: To split the dataset into training and testing sets.
    DecisionTreeClassifier: For creating a decision tree model.
    LabelEncoder: For encoding categorical variables into numeric values.

2. Define Example Data:
    {
    python

    data = {
        'Age': [25, 30, 22, 28, 35, 27, 31, 29, 24],
        'Gender': ['Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male'],
        'Music': ['Rock', 'Pop', 'Jazz', 'Classical', 'Pop', 'Rock', 'Jazz', 'Classical', 'Pop'],
        'Target': [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]  # Example target variable
    }
    }
    Creates a dictionary with data for age, gender, music preferences, and a target variable.

3. Create DataFrame:
    {
    python

    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    }
    Converts the dictionary into a pandas DataFrame.

4. Separate Features and Target:
    {
    python

    X = df[['Age', 'Gender', 'Music']].copy()
    y = df['Target']
    }
    X: Contains the feature columns (Age, Gender, Music).
    y: Contains the target column (Target).

5. Encode Categorical Variables:
    {
    python

    label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
    
    X.loc[:, 'Gender'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(X['Gender'])
    X.loc[:, 'Music'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(X['Music'])
    }
    Uses LabelEncoder to convert categorical variables (Gender and Music) into numeric values.

6. Split the Data:
    {
    python

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    }
    Splits the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

7. Initialize and Train the Model:
    {
    python

    model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    }
    Creates and trains a decision tree classifier on the training data.

8. Make Predictions:
    {
    python

    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    print(predictions)
    }
    Uses the trained model to make predictions on the test set and prints the predictions.

9. The output [0 1] represents the predictions made by the DecisionTreeClassifier on the test set. Here's a detailed explanation of how to interpret these results:

    - Model Training:
        The DecisionTreeClassifier model was trained using the X_train and y_train datasets.
        X_train contains the features (Age, Gender, Music) used to train the model.
        y_train contains the target labels corresponding to the features in X_train.

    - Test Set Predictions: 
        After training, the model was used to make predictions on X_test, which is the test set containing a subset of the original data that the model has not seen before.
        The predict method generates predictions based on the input features in X_test.
   
    - Interpreting the Predictions:
        The output [0 1] means that for the first sample in X_test, the model predicted the target label as 0, and for the second sample in X_test, the model predicted the target label as 1.
        These predictions correspond to the target labels (y_test) that were originally provided in the dataset.

    - Checking Accuracy
        To evaluate the performance of the model, you can compare the predictions against the true labels in y_test.
        For example, if y_test is [0, 1], it means the model made correct predictions for both samples.
        If y_test is [1, 0], it means the model made incorrect predictions for both samples.
    * The following code is an example of how to evaluate accuracy of the model:
        {
        from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
        
        # Print the actual labels
        print("Actual labels:", y_test.values)
        
        # Print the predictions
        print("Predictions:", predictions)
        
        # Calculate and print the accuracy
        accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
        print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
        }

        This will give you the actual labels and predictions, and it will calculate the accuracy of the model on the test set.

    * Example Output:

        Actual labels: [0 1]
        Predictions: [0 1]
        Accuracy: 1.0

        In this example, the accuracy is '1.0', meaning the model made correct predictions for all samples in the test set. If the accuracy is less than '1.0', it means there were some incorrect predictions.
        
        By comparing the predicted values to the actual values, you can get a sense of how well your model is performing.

Summary:
    This script loads example data into a DataFrame, preprocesses it by encoding categorical variables, splits the data into training and testing sets, trains a decision tree classifier, and makes predictions on the test set. The predictions are then printed to the console.
